# Basic-Analytics-Server
I Build a basic analytics server with **FastAPI**, host it on **Azure**, and containerize it using **Docker**.
Implement endpoints for processing events and generating reports.
Test the server with **Postman** and ensure correct functionality.
I integrate **joblib** for parallel HTTP requests, add machine learning analysis and using **Bland.ai**.
